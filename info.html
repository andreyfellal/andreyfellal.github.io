        Ω  Andrey is a digital nomad and a software engineering student at Liverpool John Moores University.<br><br>
        I’ve developed a personal website and worked on a few smaller projects, focusing on honing my skills in web development.<br><br>
        With a strong foundation in coding and design, I’m always looking to improve the user experience through innovative solutions.<br><br>
        Outside my academic work, I’m a passionate football fan and enjoy playing in my free time. I’ve also written an article on the philosophy of toast, sparking some lively discussions among friends and colleagues.<br><br>
        Driven by curiosity and the pursuit of growth, I’m constantly exploring new ideas both online and offline.<br><br>
